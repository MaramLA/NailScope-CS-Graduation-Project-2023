## Nail Scope

Early Diagnosis of Nail-based Diseases Using Image Processing.

### Description

To predict diseases, doctors carefully observe the changes in the color, shape, thickness, and other features of the fingernails. However, since human eyes have limitations in identifying slight color changes, image processing has been introduced in the medical field and has become a beneficial tool that helps doctors diagnose many diseases.

Nail Scope is a web-based system that helps in early diagnosis of nail-based diseases. This system detects three diseases: Melanoma, Beauâ€™s nails, and Eczema in addition to healthy nails by analyzing the patient hand nails image, which is an input to the system. Then, the image is processed, and the features of the nails, like the color, shape, and texture, will be extracted and compared to the predefined classes.

### Additional Information

This project utilizes a hybrid model approach that combines SGD classifier for classification and DensNet201 for feature extraction.
